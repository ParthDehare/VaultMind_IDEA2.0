Agent 6: RegulatoryAI
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
RBI / FIU-IND Regulatory Compliance Scoring Engine.

Rather than binary pass/fail checks, every regulation produces a
continuous "breach severity" contribution derived from:

  1. Proportional Overshoot Score (POS)
     How far the observed value exceeds the regulatory limit, expressed
     as a log-scaled ratio. A transaction 2× the IMPS limit contributes
     more than one at 1.01× the limit, but the relationship is logarithmic
     — not linear — matching how regulators weight proportionality in
     enforcement severity.

         POS(x, limit) = log2(1 + x / limit) × 100
                         normalised to [0, 100]

  2. Regulation Weight (RW)
     Each regulatory rule has an empirically assigned weight (0.0–1.0)
     reflecting its severity in RBI/FIU-IND enforcement history:
       - PMLA Section 12 violation    → 1.0 (criminal liability)
       - FEMA cross-border breach     → 0.95
       - Cash Transaction Report      → 0.85
       - Suspicious Transaction Report → 0.80
       - Channel limit breach         → 0.70

  3. Rule Composite Score
     Each fired rule contributes:
         rule_score_i = RW_i × POS_i

  4. Cumulative Regulatory Compliance Index (RCI):
     RCI = clip( Σ(rule_score_i) × escalation_factor, 0, 100 )

     escalation_factor fires when ≥ 2 rules breach simultaneously —
     regulatory co-violation is treated as a compound offence
     (mirrors RBI's "aggregate breach" escalation policy).

  5. Contextual Modifiers:
     - Calendar context (FYE: fiscal year-end surge — limits adjusted)
     - Employee class privilege multiplier (a CLERK breaching SWIFT
       limits is more suspicious than an EXECUTIVE doing so)
     - Channel-specific regulatory windows (RTGS only open 07:00–18:00)

Regulatory Rules Hardcoded (RBI Master Direction + PMLA 2002 + FEMA):
  Rule 01 — IMPS per-transaction limit (₹5,00,000)
  Rule 02 — RTGS minimum transaction floor (₹2,00,000)
  Rule 03 — NEFT daily aggregate limit per individual (₹10,00,000)
  Rule 04 — UPI per-transaction limit (₹1,00,000)
  Rule 05 — Cash Transaction Report (CTR) threshold — PMLA §12 (₹10,00,000)
  Rule 06 — Suspicious Transaction Report (STR) — PMLA §12 (structuring)
  Rule 07 — Cross-border SWIFT single transaction flag (₹50,00,000)
  Rule 08 — FEMA current account limit (₹25,00,000 / year proxy)
  Rule 09 — RTGS operating window violation (07:00–18:00)
  Rule 10 — RBI Large Value Transaction monitoring (₹1 Cr)
  Rule 11 — PAN/KYC mandatory above ₹50,000 single transaction
  Rule 12 — Benami Transactions Prohibition Act flag (structuring + amount)
  Rule 13 — PMLA Predicate Offence — aggregate daily > ₹1 Cr
  Rule 14 — FIU-IND STR mandatory filing threshold

Return contract (strict):
  {
    "severity_index": int   (0–100, Regulatory Compliance Index),
    "signal":         str   (machine-readable tag),
    "reason":         str   (plain-English XAI for FCU investigator)
